### Introduction to Machine Learning

In this module, we will explore the fundamentals of machine learning, focusing on the two primary types: supervised and unsupervised learning. You’ll learn the core concepts and applications of each, using simple examples to build a solid understanding. For supervised learning, we’ll focus exclusively on k-Nearest Neighbors for both regression and classification with an emphasis on optimizations that make it work with big data.

This module is designed as a basic introduction and will use these simple techniques to demonstrate how machine learning is applied, even on large datasets. By the end, you’ll understand the foundational differences between these approaches and their real-world relevance.
