### Clustering with k-Means and Hierarchical Methods

This notebook focuses on clustering, an unsupervised learning technique for discovering patterns in data. Weâ€™ll cover two key methods: k-Means Clustering, which partitions data into distinct groups, and Hierarchical Clustering, which builds nested clusters for more flexible grouping.

The notebook can be obtained [here](resources/clustering.ipynb)
