### Overview of Machine Learning

This notebook provides a high-level introduction to machine learning, focusing on its two main approaches: supervised learning, where models are trained on labeled data for tasks like prediction and classification, and unsupervised learning, which discovers patterns in unlabeled data through methods like clustering. It highlights key concepts, applications, and examples used in Machine learning when workign with Big Data.
