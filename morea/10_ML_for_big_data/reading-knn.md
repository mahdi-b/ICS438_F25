### Classification and Regression with k-NN

This notebook introduces classification and regression using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. You’ll learn how k-NN predicts outcomes by finding the closest data points in a dataset. We’ll explore its applications in both classification (e.g., determining if an email is spam) and regression (e.g., predicting continuous values). We will explore algoriths that allow us to scale kNN to work with large datasets.

The notebook can be obtained [here](resources/regresison_and_classification_with_nearest_neighbors.ipynb)
