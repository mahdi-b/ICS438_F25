    "### Vector Representation in Information Retrieval (IR) using TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vector Representation:\n",
    "   - Represent both queries and documents as TF-IDF vectors in a high-dimensional space\n",
    "   - Each dimension corresponds to a unique term in the corpus\n",
    "   - The value for each dimension is the TF-IDF score of that term\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Document Ranking:\n",
    "   - Rank documents based on their similarity to the query vector in this TF-IDF space\n",
    "   - Similarity is measured by how \"close\" document vectors are to the query vector\n",
    "   - Raw Euclidean distance can be misleading, especially with varying vector lengths:\n",
    "     * Longer documents (with more terms) might have larger TF-IDF vectors, leading to greater Euclidean distances even if content is relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Angle-Based Ranking:\n",
    "   - Instead of Euclidean distance, rank documents based on the angle between their TF-IDF vector and the query's TF-IDF vector\n",
    "     - less affected by vector length, focusing more on the direction (content) than magnitude (document length)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Advantages of TF-IDF in IR:\n",
    "   - Balances the importance of term frequency within a document (TF) and term uniqueness across documents (IDF)\n",
    "   - Helps to reduce the impact of common, less informative words (like \"the\", \"is\") which would have high TF but low IDF\n",
    "   - Enhances the importance of terms that are frequent in a document but rare across the corpus, likely indicating relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows for effective comparison of document relevance to queries, taking into account both the frequency of terms and their importance in distinguishing between documents."

    "1. Term frequency, Document frequency, and Normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Term frequency (tf) has several variants:\n",
    "   - n (natural): Just the raw count of a term in a document.\n",
    "   - l (logarithm): 1 + log of the term frequency.\n",
    "   - a (augmented): A formula that prevents bias towards longer documents.\n",
    "   - b (boolean): 1 if the term appears, 0 if it doesn't.\n",
    "   - L (log average): A more complex logarithmic formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Document frequency (df) has three variants:\n",
    "   - n (no): Just 1, meaning no weighting is applied.\n",
    "   - t (idf): The classic inverse document frequency formula.\n",
    "   - p (prob idf): A probabilistic version of idf.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normalization also has several options:\n",
    "   - n (none): No normalization.\n",
    "   - c (cosine): Cosine normalization.\n",
    "   - u (pivoted unique): Normalization based on unique terms.\n",
    "   - b (byte size): Normalization based on document length.\n",

    "5. THe SMART notation is a way to concisely represent different combinations of these weighting schemes. It uses a six-letter code (ddd.qqq), where:\n",
    "   - The first three letters (ddd) represent the weighting for the collection document.\n",
    "   - The second three letters (qqq) represent the weighting for the query document.\n",
    "\n",

    "- For the query document: l (log tf), n (no df weighting), n (no normalization)\n",
