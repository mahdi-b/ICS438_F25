### Data Sampling 

While large datasets can provide rich insights, processing requires
computational resources and time. What if there was a way to extract
meaningful insights without processing the entire dataset every time?
This is the promise of sampling data.

Data sampling allows us to work with a manageable subset of the data,
without compromising the quality of insights. Meanwhile, appropriate
data representation ensures that we capture the essence of the data in
more manageable formats.

This notebook delves into some simple sampling techniques. Specifically, the notebook covers: The foundational
principles of sampling and why it's crucial.

Different strategies for sampling, ensuring we capture the essence of the complete dataset.

The challenges and nuances of working with time series data.
