### Using Clustering to Sample from Large Data

Please study the following Jupyter [Notebook](resources/projections_experience.ipynb). While the comments have been intentionally removed, the code is fully documented through examples. Each function that is declared is called, and the output of each function is provided to help you understand, conceptually, what the function does.

Once you have reviewed the code and understood its purpose, please run the last two cells. Your task is to compare the results of the last cell with the one before it. Specifically, determine which method—Method 1 or Method 2—computes the cell coordinates of a large set of points more efficiently.

If you are unfamiliar with NumPy, I encourage you to do some research to understand the differences between the two methods. You can, for instance, read the [following](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/absolute_beginners.html). While we won’t be using NumPy extensively or in great depth in this course, familiarity with it is expected, as it is covered in other classes. As a data analyst, particularly when working with big data, you are expected to have some exposure to Python. The level of exposure described in this block is more than sufficient for our purposes.

Be prepared to discuss your findings in class, as we will have a group discussion on this topic where all teams **will have to** participate on Tuesday.
