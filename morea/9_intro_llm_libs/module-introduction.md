In this module, we’ll explore the fundamentals of large language models and how they can be leveraged in various applications. We’ll start with a brief introduction to LLMs (specifically enoders). Using the Hugging Face library, we’ll demonstrate how to load and run popular LLM encoders to process text and generate embeddings. Additionally, we’ll learn how to use LangChain to build interactive workflows, enabling dynamic interactions with LLMs directly in the notebook environment. By the end of this module, you’ll have hands-on experience with encoding text, generating embeddings, and designing basic pipelines to harness the power of LLMs.
