# ICS 438: Big Data Analytics

### A. Overview
Data collection and generation have become increasingly efficient and cost-effective. For instance, an individual in a high-income country produces several megabytes of data every second. Despite this technological progress, we often find ourselves overwhelmed with information yet starved for knowledge. A significant reason for this dilemma is the shortage of data-proficient professionals capable of extracting meaningful insights—whether scientific, economic, or social—from this abundance of data.

In the realm of data analytics, a variety of challenges arise, ranging from the initial stages of data ingestion and management to more nuanced areas like analysis, representation, and communication. In this course, we will explore core big data principles, with a particular focus on textual data. Our primary goal is to equip you with practical methods and tools to efficiently handle, analyze, and visualize large datasets.

### B. Course Objectives
- **Understand Core Big Data Principles**: Grasp the fundamental concepts, platforms, formats, and specifications integral to handling big data.
- **Learn Modern Techniques and Infrastructures**: Gain hands-on experience with contemporary tools and infrastructures that facilitate the efficient processing, analysis, and representation of text data.
- **Develop Proficiency in Data Handling and Analysis**: Acquire practical knowledge of essential algorithms and methodologies to efficiently manage, analyze, and derive actionable insights from large datasets.
- **Explore Modern AI Models Used with Text Data**: Become familiar with cutting-edge AI-driven models specifically designed for extracting valuable insights from textual data.

### C. Learning Outcomes
- Assess problems to determine the applicability of big data solutions and techniques.
- Gain familiarity with foundational big data analytics methodologies.
- Adapt advanced data mining approaches to efficiently handle extensive datasets.
- Craft a basic big data analytics pipeline using Python.
- Explore deep learning models for feature extraction from textual data.
- Effectively visualize and convey insights derived from big data analyses using visualization platforms. (Time permitting)

### D. Prerequisites
Students enrolling in this course should have a solid foundation in programming and be familiar with core database concepts, including querying languages. While not required, familiarity with Python will be highly beneficial.

### I. Grading and Student Evaluation
- **Grading Scale**:
  - **A**: ≥ 90%
  - **B**: ≥ 80% and < 90%
  - **C**: ≥ 70% and < 80%
  - **D**: ≥ 60% and < 70%
  - **F**: < 60%

1. **Assignments (25%)**:  
   Three short assignments will be given during the semester, all of which should be submitted as Jupyter notebooks. While the course allows flexibility in how you approach problems, note that any libraries not introduced in the lessons should not be used. Assignments should be uploaded to the designated GitHub project by 11:59 PM (HST) on their due dates. Late submissions within 24 hours will incur a 10% penalty, and those within 48 hours will incur a 50% penalty. Submissions beyond this window will not be accepted.

2. **In-Class Quizzes (40%)**:  
   Six in-class quizzes will be administered to assess your understanding of the course material. The quizzes will be short (20 minutes) and consist of multiple-choice questions. They will be closed-book with no internet access.

3. **Final Exam (30%)**:  
   A comprehensive exam will be conducted to assess your overall understanding of the course material. The exam will cover general concepts, ensuring that you not only understand specific details but can also connect themes and principles.

4. **Attendance and Participation (5%)**:  
   Students are allowed to miss up to four scheduled classes for valid reasons such as illness or religious observance. Attendance will be tracked using an online honor form with a unique code for each session. Active participation on the course's Slack channel, including responding to queries, offering feedback, or discussing course content, will also contribute to your overall grade.

### J. Academic Dishonesty
All instances of academic dishonesty, as defined below, will result in a grade of 0 for the assignment or exam and will be documented in your ICS department file. If more than one incident is recorded, the case will be referred to the Dean of Students. Disciplinary actions range from a warning to expulsion from the university. For more details, refer to the [UH Manoa Campus Policies](http://www.catalog.hawaii.edu/about-uh/campus-policies1.htm).

- **Use of ChatBots**: The use of ChatBots is permitted for assignments later in the semester, except for quizzes or exams; any unauthorized use of ChatBots will be considered academic dishonesty.
- **Academic Integrity**: The integrity of a university depends on academic honesty, which includes independent learning and research. Academic dishonesty encompasses cheating and plagiarism.
- **Cheating**: This includes, but is not limited to, giving unauthorized help during an exam, obtaining unauthorized information before an exam, using inappropriate sources during an exam, altering grades or answers after submission, falsifying official records, and misrepresenting facts to obtain exemptions from course requirements.
- **Plagiarism**: This includes submitting work copied in whole or part from another individual's work without proper citation, failing to identify a quotation, paraphrasing too closely without acknowledgment, submitting the same work in more than one course without authorization, and fabricating data to fit expected results.
- **Disciplinary Action**: The faculty member will notify the student of any alleged academic misconduct and discuss the incident. The faculty member may take academic action deemed appropriate, which may be appealed through the Academic Grievance Procedure. Cases warranting additional action will be forwarded to the Office of Judicial Affairs.
